# CR2032-Clip
## 3D model for a CR2032 battery compartment

![Screenshot of the model. It shows a cylinder withe a nut on top ans around it. On the bottom ar to ankers to hold the cylinder in the battery compartment](preview.jpg)

This is a sample for a sparepart I like to share. I have a battary compartment with an cell typ CR2032 and the lock went missing.
At this point I have the idea to replace it with a part I print with my Ender 3 Pro.
The nut around it is for a seal ring.
I thing someone can find also a use in it, so feel free to use it.

I used [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/index.php?lang=de) for the construction and [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/de/software/ultimaker-cura/?gad_source=1) to slice it.

Thanks to [Macro_FCCircularText](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros/blob/master/ObjectCreation/Macro_FCCircularText.FCMacro) for helping me place the "< Open" text on the topside.
Note: The text on the upside is not readable at this settings. If you need them, please replace them.
