# CR2032-Clip
## 3D model of a CR2032 battery compartment

![Screenshot of the model. It shows a cylinder with a nut on top and around it. On the bottom are anchor to hold the cylinder in the battery compartment](preview.jpg)

This is a sample for a spare part I like to share. I have a battery compartment with a cell type CR2032 and the lock went missing.
At this point, I have the idea to replace it with a part I print with my Ender 3 Pro.
The surrounding nut is for a seal ring.
I think someone can find also a use for it, so feel free to use it.

I used [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/index.php?lang=de) for the construction and [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/de/software/ultimaker-cura/?gad_source=1) to slice it.

Thanks to [Macro_FCCircularText](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-macros/blob/master/ObjectCreation/Macro_FCCircularText.FCMacro) for helping me place the "< Open" text on the topside.
Note: The text on the upside is not readable at these settings. If you need them, please replace them.
